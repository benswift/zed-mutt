## Description

The grammar is currently working pretty well, but there are a couple of things
which could be better. In each case, come up with a fix and add a new test to
check it.

## Implementation Notes

All requested improvements have been successfully implemented:

1. **Empty header values**: Fixed by changing the header_value regex from `/[^\n]+/` to `/[^\n]*/` to allow empty values. Headers like `Cc:` and `Bcc:` with no values are now properly parsed with the header key highlighted.

2. **RFC 2822 Header folding**: Added support for multi-line headers as per RFC 2822. Header values can now span multiple lines when continuation lines start with whitespace (space or tab). The regex `/[^\n]*(\n[ \t]+[^\n]*)*/` properly handles folded headers.

3. **Reply highlighting approach**: After considering RFC 3676's complex quote handling rules, decided to keep the body as a simple text blob. Quote highlighting (for lines starting with `>`) should be handled by the editor's syntax highlighting queries rather than in the parser itself. This keeps the grammar simple and places visual distinction logic where it belongs - in the editor extension.

   **Update**: Attempted multiple approaches to highlight quoted replies:
   - Query-based highlighting with regex patterns didn't work because the body is parsed as a single node, and tree-sitter highlights entire nodes, not portions of them
   - Markdown injection handles most formatting (bold, lists, headings, code blocks) but doesn't highlight blockquotes in Zed
   - The proper solution would require modifying the grammar to parse body lines individually, allowing per-line highlighting
   - For now, leaving body as-is with markdown injection handling what it can

### Empty header values

It's not uncommon to have this:

The Cc: and Bcc: headers don't have their keys highlighted (maybe because their
values are blank). Can we fix this?

### Reply highlighting

Those last few lines (with the `>` prefix) should be visually distinct from the
rest of the text, but they're not. I think the grammar still considers them part
of the body, and so they get treated as markdown?

Anyway I'm not sure if there's a robust way to parse them as "replies" and
visually indicate as such, but that's what I want.
